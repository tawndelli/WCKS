                    <h3>Wing Chun Lineage</h3>
                    <p>
                        Sifu Joseph Musse studied directly under Sifu Duncan Leung in New York City. Sifu Duncan Leung is a Disciple of the late GrandMaster Ip Man. Gm Ip Man was Bruce Lee's teacher and Bruce Lee
                        gives credit and acknowledgment to Wing Chun as being fundamental to his success
                        in his martial arts career.
                    </p>
                    <h3>Kali (Eskrima)</h3>
                    <p>
                        The founder Sifu Joseph Musse studied several different systems of Filipino Kali . He has trained under world wide renowned Kali Practitioners. This form of weapons based Martial Art was put
                        into the Wing Chun Kali System due to its effectiveness when it comes to fighting for the streets, weapons and/or one or more attackers. It's a Great Martial Arts System to learn.
                    </p>
                    <h3>Our Schools</h3>
                    <p>
                        There are established Wing Chun Kali System Schools in Houston, Texas, New York, North Carolina, New Jersey, and Puerto Rico. We are a growing organization with the goal of teaching this
                        complete system of Martial Arts.

                            The Wing Chun Kali System was founded in 1987 by Sifu Joseph Musse. This system is comprised of Wing Chun Kung Fu and Filipino Kali and the focus of both of these Martial Arts is pure Self Defense.
                            The training method and teaching of this system is for the practitioner to be able to defend himself/herself effectively in case of an altercation in the streets.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The Wing Chun Kali System is broken down into two forms of Martial Arts. Each one of these has its own self-defense mentality and fighting applications. Both of these Martial Arts are extremely practical and
                            effective for self-defense. Wing Chun Kung Fu focuses more on empty hand fighting and the Kali (Eskrima) focuses more on weapon based fighting applications.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The Wing Chun Kali System covers the different scenarios that can occur in a fight. Such as fighting more than one attacker, defending yourself against weapons, closing from the different ranges from long range to close range.
                            This is why it is called a System, it covers all the different areas making the Wing Chun Kali System practitioner well rounded.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Wing Chun Kung Fu and Filipino Kali are taught individually, each system keeping its purity and its applications. However these Arts complement each other extremely well. Kali covers a deep science of understanding when it
                            comes to bladed weapons and Wing Chun covers other bases such as structure, timing and concepts. Together these 2 martial arts bring a powerful and practical system of self-defense that is called the Wing Chun Kali System.

                        Each type of martial arts that is taught here in our school - Wing Chun Kung Fu and Filipino Kali - are taught separately, meaning that we do not mix them together. However there are certain similarities
                        and principals that make Wing Chun and Kali the perfect compliment to each other.
